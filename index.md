# Hi, I'm Adela

I am a student at the University of Creative Communication specializing in graphic design.
I gather experience in the field of graphics, media, marketing, typography, illustration and drawing.
I try to gradually improve in as many areas as possible in today's fast-paced world of advertising and media, so that I can then offer as many of my skills as possible.

As part of my studies, I also have experience with real clients; with the creation of a logo, visual identity, marketing campaign, social networks, typographic works including book layout and illustrations.

I love colors and their power.
Every project is a new challenge for me to improve and improve.
