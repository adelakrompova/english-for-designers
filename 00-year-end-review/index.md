# Year End Review

##1) What did you like most about this course?

I liked that the courses were not about grammar, but mainly about presenting oneself and one's work. It was great to try and learn to think in English. And the best part was that we were not divided according to our language level and the approach was the same for each of us. Thanks for that.ðŸ˜Š

##2) What did you like least about this course?

Sometimes three hours seemed like too much to me. But others probably decide on that. However, most of the hours flew by quickly for me, thanks to interesting activities, presentations, and topics.

##3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

- To speak better and more! Finally! I didn't know how to do it for a long time, I have some sort of block in my head (or maybe it's just my laziness, haha:D), but thanks to our classes, my English communication is much better now.

- Not being afraid to make mistakes. Everyone makes them. Thinking about mistakes just makes me nervous and slows me down. The main thing is to communicate and understand each other.

- To write and present at the required level.

##4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

##5) Whatâ€™s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?

##6) Whatâ€™s one thing you learned about yourself?

##7) Whatâ€™s one thing you could have done better?

##8) Whatâ€™s one thing I could have done better?

I think that some topics could be conveyed in a different way than through long videos, where attention is lost after just two minutes. But that's the only thing from the pile of great ones!

##9) Whatâ€™s one thing you would add or change about this course?

##10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?
