# Year End Review

## 1) What did you like most about this course?

I liked that the classes were not about grammar but mainly about presenting oneself and oneâ€™s work. It was great to try and learn to think in English. And the best part was that we were not divided according to our language level and the approach was the same for each of us. Thanks for that.ðŸ˜Š

## 2) What did you like least about this course?

Sometimes three hours seemed like too much to me. But others probably decide on that. However, most of the hours flew by quickly for me, thanks to interesting activities, presentations, and topics.

## 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?

- To speak better and more! Finally! I didn't know how to do it for a long time, I have some sort of block in my head (or maybe it's just my laziness, haha:D), but thanks to our classes, my English communication is much better now.

- Not being afraid to make mistakes. Everyone makes them. Thinking about mistakes just makes me nervous and slows me down. The main thing is to communicate and understand each other.

- To write and present at the required level.

## 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?

The very first lesson, when we divided into groups and had to describe certain shapes to others. It was something different than any other class, and that's when I thought, "Yes, I'm going to enjoy these classes." And I was right.ðŸ˜Š

## 5) Whatâ€™s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?

I was able to get up in front of classmates and speak English. I am also proud of my portfolio created here on GitHub.

## 6) Whatâ€™s one thing you learned about yourself?

That I can be funny in English too.ðŸ˜‚

## 7) Whatâ€™s one thing you could have done better?

Sometimes I could have tried harder because I know I can do more. I could also have gone to bed earlier on Monday evenings to be more active during Tuesday's classes. Unfortunately, the beginnings of the week in this summer semester were more demanding.

## 8) Whatâ€™s one thing I could have done better?

I think that some topics could be conveyed in a different way than through long videos, where attention is lost after just two minutes. But that's the only thing from the pile of great ones!

## 9) Whatâ€™s one thing you would add or change about this course?

I can't think of anything significant to add. The things I mentioned earlier are just minor details. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, I have only pleasant memories of our classes and I know that I learned a lot. Thank you!ðŸ˜Š

## 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?

The year will pass by very quickly, so enjoy it and don't be afraid to speak up!

### Justin, I am very glad that you taught me. I learned a lot of things, not just about English, and they have moved me forward. Keep doing what you do and how you do it, you are doing it well! Thank you again, have a great time and be successful.ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒ¸
