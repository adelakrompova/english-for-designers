## Abstract

This bachelorâ€˜s thesis eplores with the creation of a new visual identity and communication for the private castle Boskovice.
The aim of the thesis is to create a design that will bring the castle into the 21st century, while at the same time preserving respect for its aristocratic owners and history. The new visual style by which the castle presents itself includes a logo, typography, color scheme, and photography, and draws inspiration from the object itself and its history. This style is then reflected in the marketing communication, which involves promoting the castle and its activities through printed materials, the website, publications, online media, and souvenirs. The new identity should thus connect the historic object with modern communication and demonstrate that design with a gentle emphasis on history leads to better awareness of the castle and other cultural heritage sites in our country.

The theoretical part focuses on defining visual identity, basic graphic design concepts, and marketing communication. It also provides a closer description of marketing in the cultural industry and is followed by an analysis of the communication of state and private heritage sites. The practical part deals with the creation of the new visual style of the castle and its subsequent implementation in the new castle communication.

The result of the thesis should be the creation of a unified visual identity that will function in the long term in the specific industry of cultural and heritage tourism, and attract a wider audience to the private castle, of which there are dozens in our country, in a non-invasive and elegant way.
