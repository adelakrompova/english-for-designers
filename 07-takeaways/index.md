# Takeaways

## Five things I learned this semester in 2022:

1. How to work with (hellish tool) GitHub. But finally I enjoyed it!
2. How to make my CV and portfolio much more creative.
3. Better presentation in English.
4. Have English lessons with a native speaker.
5. Be less nervous about my English.

## Thank you, Justin!
