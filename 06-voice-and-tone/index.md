# Voice and Tone

## Voice

I communicate professionally, with a balanced amount of emotion, kindness and humor. Preferably with a cup of coffee or even a glass of wine. In my opinion, a relaxed atmosphere is the best way to agree to the satisfaction of both myself and the client.

✨ authentic and inspiring

☕️ relaxed and non-serious 

🤝 professional with a bit of humour

## Tone

My tone is positive, respectful and emphatic. I try to be fair and honest, but always with a smile and in no way offensive.

☺️ friendly

🌞 positive

💪 strong

## Style

I search and combine my own handwriting and style typical for me, which I always try to more or less inscribe in each of my work and projects.
