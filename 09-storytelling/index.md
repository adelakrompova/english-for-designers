## Write motivation letter like a master

A motivational letter is a document that serves to present the personality, experience, and motivation of an applicant for a job position, study program, or other opportunity. The motivational letter may be a part of a job or school application and serves to convince the employer or admissions committee that the applicant has the necessary qualifications and motivation for the given position or study program.

Motivational letters are still important nowadays. Through a letter, one can better present their qualities, experience, and work achievements.

As a self-proclaimed amateur expert in writing motivational letters, I would like to share a few tips that have helped me in finding my dream job. 
I have compiled these helpful tips into the following points:

- ### Make it clear that you know where and for which job position you are applying.
    Everyone appreciates it when they see that you have learned and remembered something about them.
    
    You have another argument for why you want to work specifically in this position - for example, because it is a well-known brand with a long tradition 
at a professional level. (I used this phrasing in my cover letter and of course, I succeeded. So come up with something of your own.)
    
   Or mention that you like their activities (you can mention something specific) or projects, and you would like to be involved in them as well.
    
    
    ðŸ¤— <font color="#008000">Your offer has attracted me because you are a prestigious institution with a long-standing tradition and a professional level. 
        I would be delighted to participate in your projects that bring joy to the general public and, above all, promote awareness in an important field.</font>
    
    ðŸ˜© <font color="FF0000">I'm hearing about you for the first time, but you look good, I need a job and I don't really care what I'll be doing.</font>

- ### Dedicate one paragraph to your education, skills, and experience.

    Note! Do not make things up, do not praise yourself excessively, and do not overdo it in general. 
    
    Briefly describe your field of education and interests. Highlight only the most interesting skills that could be useful to you.
    
    It is an advantage if you know in advance what is required of you in the position, then it is useful (modestly!) to emphasize that you know how to do this and  that. Of course, not perfectly, nobody is perfect, except for the person you are sending the letter to. That goes without saying.
    
    ðŸ¤— <font color="#008000">I have been working and educating myself in the field of (â€¦) for almost (â€¦) years. I try to stay up to date with current creative trends while also striving to be original in my work and develop my own distinct style. During my high school studies, I acquired (â€¦) My university studies focused more on the world of advertising, marketing, and media graphics. I have learned to communicate with clients and am also involved in some projects of our school agency to further expand my portfolio and experience. Furthermore, I strive to improve in my field and enjoy learning new things.</font>
    
    ðŸ˜© <font color="FF0000">I have three university degrees, all completed with honors. I have three titles before and after my name. I know and can do everything you can think of. Whatever you say, I know and can do it. You must want me.</font>
    
 - ### Sell yourself. But not cheaply.

    Tactfully highlight your positive personal qualities. Are you loyal, creative, flexible, communicative, hardworking? Brag about it! But again, no inventing, no overly positive adjectives.

    Adapt your skills and qualities to the position offered and to what can be expected from you.
    
     ðŸ¤— <font color="#008000">I believe that my attention to detail, hardworking nature, and visual sense make me a suitable candidate for the job position you are offering.</font>
     
     ðŸ˜© <font color="FF0000">I am perfect and humble. I will meet all your expectations. I am simply the ideal candidate, you won't find anyone better.</font>
     
 - ### Be honest. (If you don't believe me, recall all the sayings about lies, hell, and so on.)
 - ### Remember, less is sometimes more.
 - ### Don't write a novel about yourself. (Even if you're applying for a position in a publishing house). People are generally too lazy to read. One A4 page is more than enough.
 - ### Say goodbye with a wish for a nice day. And feel free to add that you're looking forward to the next meeting. Passive-aggressive pressure doesn't  hurt here.

## That's all. Thank you for your attention. You will thank me later.
