## Write motivation letter like a master

A motivational letter is a document that serves to present the personality, experience, and motivation of an applicant for a job position, study program, or other opportunity. The motivational letter may be a part of a job or school application and serves to convince the employer or admissions committee that the applicant has the necessary qualifications and motivation for the given position or study program.

Motivational letters are still important nowadays. Through a letter, one can better present their qualities, experience, and work achievements.

As a self-proclaimed amateur expert in writing motivational letters, I would like to share a few tips that have helped me in finding my dream job. 
I have compiled these helpful tips into the following points:

- ### Make it clear that you know where and for which job position you are applying.
    Everyone appreciates it when they see that you have learned and remembered something about them.
    You have another argument for why you want to work specifically in this position - for example, because it is a well-known brand with a long tradition at a       professional level. (I used this phrasing in my cover letter and of course, I succeeded. So come up with something of your own.)
    Or mention that you like their activities (you can mention something specific) or projects, and you would like to be involved in them as well.

I would be delighted to participate in your projects that bring joy to the general public and, above all, promote awareness in an important field.
