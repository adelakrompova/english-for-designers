# Visual identity and communication for the private castle Boskovice

I am a big enthusiast of historical landmarks and history in general. That's why my bachelor's thesis topic is related to this hobby of mine. I wanted to combine history and heritage objects with the field that I am studying, and I hope I managed to do so.

The Boskovice Castle currently lacks clear visual communication. All communication, whether on social media or the website, is conveyed through photographs of the castle building and its interiors. The castle doesn't have a defined visual style and therefore lacks a way to differentiate itself from competitors, as it lacks any distinctive memorable aspect. 

From the beginning, I knew that I wanted to portray the Boskovice Castle in a more elegant manner than it has been done so far. My intention was to showcase the castle as a significant regional object with a rich history that still has a lot to offer. I wanted it to be perceived as a prominent place in a small town where a broader public can gather not only to learn about the history and castle past but also for relaxation or cultural experience. As the castle is privately owned by an important aristocratic family originally from France, I didn't want it to appear cheap or similar to state-owned objects. In the overall concept, I tried to highlight the ubiquitous and unique atmosphere of the noble residence and suggest, in an elegant way, that it is accessible to everyone interested in history, culture, or entertainment, while still fitting in with the mood of the castle complex.

### The concept of visual identity

- Empire style

### Moodboard

This moodboard for my concept reflects all the mentioned aspects. It includes the Empire axis, castle elegance, minimalist symmetry, and cultural activities.

### Color palette

I took the gold and dark blue colors from the coat of arms of the family that owns the castle. Since the combination of gold and blue is typical for castles, I looked for colors that would appropriately differentiate Boskovice Castle, and shades of green seemed to be the best choice. It corresponds to the castle garden, greenhouse, and outdoor events, which are often held there. At the same time, it is more modern, highlighting the castle's use for modern-day purposes. The cream color reflects not only the colors of the entrance hall and staircase but also a certain elegance, delicacy, and minimalism of French design.
