# Case study

Every illustator has his own style of drawing, something what defines him. 
That was the thing why I wanted to have my own too. 

All of my illustrations have satured monochrome background. With the background colour I try to capture the whole mood of the illustration. The rest of it is drawn by hand, with few simple lines, sometimes a bit imperfectly (yup, it has its purpose) and with no shading.

It's probably the most easiest way of illustration but I adore it and every of them has something from me in it.
Also I must humbly add that all feedbacks on some of my work were positive.

The simpliest ones are for famous people, where I choose some famous photo and redraw it with my hand,often then I add colours based on topic or mood of the whole picture.
